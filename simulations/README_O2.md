# O2 Simulation Infrastructure -- surrogate-transportability

Repeatable, memory-efficient infrastructure for running R simulation studies on
the Harvard O2 SLURM cluster. Every study uses the **same layout** and the same
lifecycle, so once you learn one you know them all.

See `TRANSFER.md` for exact file-transfer commands (SSH-key auth, no passwords).

    ├── logs/latest        # -> current run's scratch log dir (symlink)

    └── MANIFEST.md        # current run-id, git SHA, sizing, job ids
```

## Storage discipline (scratch vs home)

- **Scratch** `/n/scratch/users/d/dma12/surrogate-transportability/<study>/<run-id>/`
  holds all per-task result files and logs. Fast, large, **not backed up**,
  purged periodically. New code never mixes with old output because each run-id
  gets its own subtree.
- **Home** `results/<run-id>.rds` holds only the single combined final result
  per run (100 GiB quota, backed up). `combine.R` is the only thing that writes
  there.

## Lifecycle (per study)

```bash
cd simulations/<study-name>

# 1. Edit the science: config/grid.R, R/dgp.R, R/estimators.R, R/run_one.R.
#    Include at least one STRESS regime (Constitution Section 9).

# 2. LOCALLY: profile a few units to size the array for a 1-3 hr/task target.
Rscript slurm/profile_timing.R --target-hours 2
#    -> writes config/sizing.env + config/sizing.json

# 3. Commit + push; on O2 `git pull`. (See TRANSFER.md.)

# 4. ON O2: submit. Mints a run-id, sets up scratch, writes MANIFEST.md.
bash slurm/submit.sh

# 5. ON O2: monitor. Shows progress, newest logs, and failed tasks.
bash slurm/monitor.sh                # add --tail-failures to debug
#    Re-running submit.sh resumes: tasks whose scratch file exists are skipped.

# 6. ON O2: combine into the single home result (errors loudly if code changed
#    since submission, or if tasks are missing).
Rscript slurm/combine.R --run-id <run-id> \
  --scratch-dir /n/scratch/users/d/dma12/surrogate-transportability/<study>/<run-id> \
  --study-dir .

# 7. Pull results/<run-id>.rds back to your machine (see TRANSFER.md).

# 8. ON O2: clean superseded scratch runs (home results kept).
bash slurm/clean.sh
```

## Adding another study

Re-invoke the `/setup-cluster-simulations` skill with a new study name. It
scaffolds a new `simulations/<new-study>/` subtree with the identical structure
and leaves existing studies untouched. Studies never collide: scratch, logs, and
results are all namespaced by study name.

## How this addresses common O2 pain points

| Pain point | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| Different folder structures per project | One enforced layout scaffolded every time |
| Intermediate files clutter home | Scratch for per-task files/logs; home for final only |
| Hard to find recent logs | Run-id-namespaced log dir + `logs/latest` + `monitor.sh` newest-first listing |
| Stale results/logs after code changes | Per-run-id scratch subtree + source-code-hash guard in `combine.R` (loud fail) |
| Array > 1000 tasks | `submit.sh` chunks into <=1000-task arrays |
| > 10000 jobs at once | `submit.sh` throttles with `%cap` and submits dependent waves |
| Guessing wall time | `profile_timing.R` sizes reps/job from measured per-unit time (1-3 hr) |
| Out-of-memory | `profile_timing.R` sizes `--mem` from measured peak memory |
| Transfer command format | `TRANSFER.md` with exact, SSH-key-based O2 commands |

## Known-good practices baked in

- `library()` (not `devtools::load_all()`) -- module R has no devtools.
- Explicit `dest=` on every optparse option -- avoids hyphenated-arg parse bugs.
- Zero-padded task ids (`task_000123.rds`) -- consistent sort/glob.
- One-row **data frame** results (never lists) -- clean `rbind` in `combine.R`.
- Deterministic per-unit seeds (`BASE_SEED + unit`) -- reproducible & independent.
- Idempotent tasks -- resubmit to resume; existing task files are skipped.
- Atomic writes (`.tmp` then rename) -- no half-written result files.
